# Planet-Lens-Display
A beautiful project that uses colored lenses to focus concentric circles onto a screen.  These colored circles represent the layers (core, mantle, atmosphere, etc.) of whichever planet was chosen.

The display has a button board - each button is for a different planet in the solar system and has an LED colored to go with the planet.  When the user presses a button, the display runs motors to raise or lower two lenses which are suspended by string.  When the lenses reach their new positions, they focus light onto a screen above.  This creates concentric circles which are [roughly] proportional to the cross-section of the chosen planet.

Of course, this information could be represented more easily and accurately by an LCD display.  However, the point of this display is not WHAT it's representing but HOW it is represented.  It is an interactive art piece.
